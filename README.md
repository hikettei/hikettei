### hikettei🌙

hikettei is a Japanese student with a deep love for **Common Lisp**. I have **a strong interest in deep learning compiler technology** and develop scientific computing libraries, such as **cl-waffe2**, as a hobby using Common Lisp. My career as an **AI engineer** began with **quantization and deep learning compilers**. Currently, I am also involved in developing compilers using C++/Python etc.
