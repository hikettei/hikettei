### hikettei🌙

hikettei is a 18yo Japanese student with a deep love for **Common Lisp**. I have **a strong interest in deep learning compiler technology** and develop scientific computing libraries, such as **cl-waffe2**, as a hobby using Common Lisp. My career as an **AI engineer** began with **quantization and deep learning compilers**. Currently, I am also involved in developing compilers using C++/Python etc. My current goal is to implement **a better ecosystem for deep learning on Common Lisp**, including a versatile/tiny/modular/fastest/abstract deep learning system with minimal dependencies.

```lisp
(make-instance 'hikettei
    :name (apply #'whichever-you-like `(:rulia :hikettei))
    :languages '((:japanese . "mother tongue")
                 (:english  . "Known as typo expert"))
    :pronoun "he/him")
```
