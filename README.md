### hikettei🌙

**Bio:** Undergraduate in the Faculty of Environment and Information Studies at Keio University, majoring in Computer Science. (19yo)

**Skills / Interests**: Common Lisp, Deep Learning, Compilers (e.g., Polyhedral Compiler, Auto Scheduler), Neural Network Quantization (especially in CV models), HPC, Scientific Computing, etc. — I am particularly passionate about approaching deep learning and LLM technologies from a low-level perspective and optimizing them.

**Projects and Activities**:

- ⚡️ [**Caten**](https://github.com/hikettei/Caten) is _an experimental deep learning compiler project developed entirely from scratch in Common Lisp._ The most challenging aspect of this project is its use of RISC-style instructions, designed to simplify porting to different hardware. Internally, it employs a polyhedral compiler as a low-level IR to optimize auto-generated kernels.

    Currently, I am seeking sponsors to continue development after starting university; strong financial support would enable me to further simplify the codebase while expanding support to a wider range of models, hardware, and quantization.

- I love contributing to open-source tensor compiler projects (e.g., [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)).

- or doing some trivial OSS projects in Common Lisp ...

🏆 **Awards and Honors**

- U22 Programming Content METI Minister’s award.
- Sōkan no Susume Scholarship, Keio University.
